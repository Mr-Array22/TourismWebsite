			<p>Erciyes Ski Center is on Mount Erciyes (3,916 m), the highest summit of Anatolia, in the south Erciyes Province. Mount Erciyes is a young extinct volcano, presenting visitors with several visible volcanic cones. The higher points of Mount Erciyes are covered in snow throughout the year while on its north side there is an iceberg. A crater was formed by external effects and several steep hillocks appeared. At the summit of Mount Erciyes, among the rock columns, there is a cave that was used by Byzantine monks for religious ceremonies. On the northern slope there is a 700-meter-high mountain glacier, and on the eastern slope at an elevation of 2,100-2,900 meters, the Tekir plateau hosts a winter sports center. The hike from the ski lift to the campsite at Cobaninine takes about 2.5-3 hours in winter. The climb from Cobaninine to Mola Tasi, at the headwaters of <em>Şeytan </em>Creek (Devil’s Creek), takes an hour, and climbing on cross-country skis is popular. From here, it takes about 2-3 hours to reach the summit of the smaller peak. In winter, there is a danger of avalanches at <em>Şeytan</em> Creek and in the spring (May - June), it is necessary to wear a helmet because of the falling rocks.
			</p>
			<p>Erciyes is the world’s most centralized ski resort by virtue of its geographical position: it is possible to access one-third of the world with a 4-hour flight.
