			<p>Burj Khalifa (Arabic for 'Khalifa Tower') is the world's tallest man-made structure at 829.8 m (2,722 ft). The centerpiece of Downtown Dubai, Burj Khalifa is a world-class skyscraper and urban masterpiece surrounded by luxury hotels, a wealth of entertainment options and must-see shopping destinations. One of the most popular attractions in Dubai, Burj Khalifa is home to a number of points of interest including parklands, an observation deck, a hotel and a range of residential and office spaces.</p><p>Burj Khalifa features an impressive entry and outdoor living space known as The Park which features 11 ha of water features and greenery. The Park includes a promenade around Dubai lake, a prow lookout, outdoor dining, play areas, outdoor spaces, water features, a leisure forest grove and much more. There are six major water features in the landscape design in total including the fountain at the main entry, a fountain at the hotel entry, a fountain at the residential entry, a grand water terrace, fountain pool for children and a sculptural fountain.
			</p>
			<p>The highlight of any visit to Burj Khalifa is the awe-inspiring view from 'At The Top' the building's observation deck. Located on level 124, the journey to the top is also impressive. Beginning on the ground level of Dubai Mall, the trip is a lesson on Dubai's exotic history thanks to an informative multi-media presentation. The high-speed elevator travels at 10m per second and brings you to the floor-to-ceiling glass walls that display panoramic views of the city, ocean and desert from your vantage point on level 124.
			</p>
			<p>Particularly breathtaking at night, sparkling lights mark the city below while special telescopes offer real-time and virtual time-lapse visions of the view below. Allowing you to see close-up views of the past, present and future, these telescopes ensure there is no bad time to visit Burj Khalifa. You can also enjoy comprehensive views from the perimeter or step outside onto the open-air terrace to experience a new perspective on the views below.
			</p>
			<p>For that extra touch of luxury, the building is also home to the world's first hotel developed and designed by Giorgio Armani. Reflecting his signature style of sophistication, elegance and simplicity, the comfortable accommodation is located from the concourse level up to level 8 as well as levels 38 and 39 and offer breathtaking views of Dubai.</p>
